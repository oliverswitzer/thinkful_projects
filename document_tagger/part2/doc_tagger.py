#************* For Matching Document Info ***************

# PREPARE OUR REGEXES FOR METADATA SEARCHES #
# we'll use re.compile() here, which allows you to assign a regex pattern
# to a variable. We'll do this for each our metadata fields.
# 
# Also note how we're using paretheses to create two search groups. Looking
# at title_search, see how we use one group to match on the presence of "title:".
# 
# Also, note how in the second group is a named group -- we use ?p<name> .
# 
# Finally, note that we're passing the re.IGNORECASE flag as an optional
# argument to re.compile. We're doing this because it's human beings who create
# the metadata headers at the top of Project gutenberg docs, and we want to account 
# for possibility of "title: Some Title", "Title: Some Title", and "TITLE: Some Title").

# is at index 0 in sys.argv, so we'll slice everything from index 1 forward.

#************* For loop to return doc info AND keyword info in each iteration ***************

# for each one. Note the use of enumerate here, which gives you a counter variable
# (in this case 'i') that keeps track of the index of the list (in this case documents)
# your currently on in your loop. You should memorize how enumerate works, and google it
# if you need more explanation. It's a highly productive built in function, and there are
# common problems that you'll encounter as a programmer that enumerate is great for.
